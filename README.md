I think I've finally morphed into a fledgling computer geek. After a break from computers for almost 3 years, I've spent the last three days and nights glued to my PC screen (fuelled by countless fags and coffee, I might add). I'm so sorry for leaving you Miss Interwebs, I know I've been away for a long time, but I'm back and promise to never leave you again. Lovely Miss Interwebs.
